Description about the algorithm used:

The algorithm creates a dynamic artwork using Perlin Noise to generate fluid and organic patterns.
It initializes an array of objects that move according to noise-generated vectors, creating smooth, non-repetitive movement paths.
Each object has a "lifespan" and gradually changes in size and fades away, ensuring a continuous flow of new objects while old ones disappear.
I chose the colours and background music in order to enhance the immersive experience.

Description about the technology used:

I used Processing, JavaScript and HTML for my project. It's a specific mode in Processing called p5.js, which I had to download.

Description about the end result:

I am really content with my results as the code is not too difficult, but still it creates a satisfactory outcome. I had problems with adding the background music, 
because I had to figure out how to add sound to the p5.js mode. There is another library I had to download in order to make it work. Additionally, I had to
turn on Auto-Play in my Safari-Browser, otherwise the music would have been blocked.
